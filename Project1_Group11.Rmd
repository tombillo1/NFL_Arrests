### Data:

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/washingtonpost/nfl-arrests
This dataset gives insight into the arrest data within NFL stadiums. It includes columns for season, week number, day of the week, game time, home team, away team, home score, away score, overtime, and if it is a division game. 

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
data = read.csv("arrests.csv")
head(data)
```

## Research Question:

Is there a correlation between a home team losing the game and the number of arrests that are made within a stadium?
