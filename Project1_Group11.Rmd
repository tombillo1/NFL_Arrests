### Data:

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/washingtonpost/nfl-arrests
This dataset gives insight into the arrest data within NFL stadiums. It includes columns for season, week number, day of the week, game time, home team, away team, home score, away score, overtime, and if it is a division game. 

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(caret)
data = read.csv("arrests.csv")
data$score_diff = data$home_score - data$away_score
head(data)
```

## Research Question:

Is there a correlation between the score differential in a game and the number of arrests made within a stadium? 

## Data visualization and analysis:

```{r}
correlation = cor(data$arrests, data$score_diff, use = "complete.obs")
correlation
plot(y = data$arrests, x = data$score_diff)

```
